        <p>I am from Kakinada, India. I have completed my schooling in my hometown and did my

        <h3>Vegetable Biriyani</h3>
        <p> My all-time favorite dish is Vegetable biriyani. I like it becuase, it is created with a blend of 
            spices, veggies, and rice and not only with veggies, there are typically some kind of meat 
            (chicken, goat, lamb, shrimp, or fish) are used to make it. Sometimes without any meat, other 
            times with eggs and potatoes.  </p>
